# Image Recolorization for the Colorblind

This project focuses on image recolorization to enhance visual accessibility for colorblind users. It adjusts colors in images to improve contrast and distinguishability while preserving the overall look.
The project builds upon the paper [Image recolorization for the colorblind](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220733211_Image_recolorization_for_the_colorblind) by Jia-Bin Huang, Chu Song Chen et al.

## Features

**Color Adjustment Algorithms**: Modifies color schemes for better visibility.\
**Real-Time Processing**: Fast recolorization suitable for dynamic content.\
**User Customization**: Allows adjustments based on specific color vision deficiencies.

## Tech Stack

**Python**: for image processing and algorithm implementation.\
**OpenCV**: for color manipulation and visualization.
